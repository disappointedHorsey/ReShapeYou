# ReShapeYou
AI generative technology to enable everyone to previsualise weight loss
ReShapeYou is a revolutionary way to transform your body and spirit. Lose the extra weight and become the person you can really be!
With ReShapeYou, you can easily reach your weight goals. We'll show you what you'll look like if you lose the extra weight and keep you motivated along the way. Just click a body shot (gotta mirror?), tell us how many pounds or kgs you’d like to lose and we’ll show you the image of an achievable and real new you!
ReShapeYou will help to increase your self-esteem and confidence. Reach your weight goals, and you'll see the results in your life and attitude.
The how...  1. Collect a large dataset of images of people's bodies, including both the original image and images of the same person at different body weights. This dataset should include images of people with a variety of body types, shapes, and sizes.
2. Annotate the images with labels indicating the person's weight and body mass index (BMI) for each image.
3. Preprocess the images to ensure they are all the same size and format, and to normalize the lighting and color.
4. Train a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to analyze the images and learn the relationships between a person's weight and their appearance.
5. Use the trained model to generate images that show what a person would look like if they lost a specified number of pounds or kilograms in body weight. To do this, the model should be able to modify the original image in a way that is realistic and preserves the person's unique features and characteristics.
6. Evaluate the model's performance by comparing the generated images to real images of people at different weights. Use metrics such as structural similarity index (SSIM) or mean squared error (MSE) to measure the similarity between the generated images and the ground truth.
7. Fine-tune the model as needed to improve its performance, using techniques such as transfer learning or adjusting the model architecture.
8. Deploy the trained model in a production environment, where it can be used to generate images of people at different body weights based on user input.
